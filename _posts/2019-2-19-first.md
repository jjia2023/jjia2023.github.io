#You will come to Nosy Be with us
##Here is some information to help you plan your trip.

FORMALITIES
For most travellers, the passport is mandatory and must be valid for at least six months after your return. This information is given for information purposes only and may change, we recommend that you check with the embassies of Madagascar in your home country
A tourist visa is required to enter Madagascar. It can be obtained directly from Antananarivo and Nosy Be airports. Price: It is 31€ for less than 30 days and 31 days to 60 days is 39€ and 61 days to 90 days is 54€.
Some consulates still continue to issue visas (which would save you time on arrival), so it is advisable to call the embassy or consulate for the latest formalities.
